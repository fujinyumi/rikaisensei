# Rikaisensei

A clone of [Rikaikun](https://github.com/melink14/rikaikun), the Chrome port of [Rikaichan](http://www.polarcloud.com/rikaichan).

Rikaisensei is a work-in-progress, but hopes to include the following functionality:

* Saving vocabulary words on hover-over to your personal Vocab List
	* Ideally done in a easily human-readable, user-friendly GUI with a gentle learning curve
	* Possibly giving a option to require highlight rather than roll-over to prevent Rikaichan over-reliance, though changing the parsing code to deinflect this may be difficult (need to look into the src)
* Including more dictionaries (not under JMDict, with no affiliation to the EDRDG) which may be useful to certain users
* Possibly including cross-functionality with Anki or Quizlet using their respective APIs, depending on functionality
* Possibly audio and pitch accent support
* ...And More as they come
